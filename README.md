# Impact-of-Social-Media-on-the-Box-Office-Data-Science-project

Do you think posts and comments by audience members on social media channels like twitter, can sway the public opinion and increase or decrease the ticket sales of movies?

This is what we are going to do to find possible answers for our question: we will collect tweets about the best picture nominees of Oscars 2018; we collect tweets starting 4 weeks before the release date of each movie and we stop collecting 1 week after their closing date. Next we analyze the twitter activities (leading role actors twitter accounts, number of tweets, sentiment of tweets, rating and reviews of the movie) and explore possible relationships between twitter activities and ticket sales.
